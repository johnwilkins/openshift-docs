= Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator

Node Feature Discovery (NFD) streamlines the process of matching {product-title} cluster workloads to node capabilities. The NFD Operator detects hardware features available on each node in an {product-title} cluster. On the control plane nodes, the NFD daemon receives labeling requests from worker nodes and modifies worker node objects with node labels. This enables the NFD Operator to advertise the features of specific nodes.

.Procedure

Install the NFD Operator from link:operatorhub.io/operator/nfd-operator[OperatorHub.io: Node Feature Discovery].

. Install the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) tool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.18.1/install.sh | bash -s v0.18.1
----
+
This tool helps manage the Operators running on your cluster.

. Install the NFD Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc kubectl -f https://operatorhub.io/install/nfd-operator.yaml
----

. Watch the NFD Operator initialize:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv -n operators
----

To use NFD, refer to the link:https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.8/get-started/[Node Feature Discovery] documentation.
